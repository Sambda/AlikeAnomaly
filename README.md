# Anomaly Detection
Innovative Mobile Applications LMU 2019
Applied deep learning on audio files
Within the context of "ErLoWa â€“ Automated detection and localisation of leaks in water supply networks"

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python
* Keras using TensorFlow backend
* librosa

## Installation
Pre-requirements:
- install python 
- install libav

```bash
conda create -n imapps_venv python=3
conda activate imapps_venv

#install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation GPU
- install miniconda
- add to file .zshrc_local in your home directory (maybe you need to create it first):
```bash
# Add for Miniconda3

export PATH=$HOME/miniconda3/bin:PATH
. $HOME/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin && clear
```
- if this is not working, try to add everything except the last line to file .zshrc

- create conda environment and activate it:
```bash
conda create -n "name_of_env"
conda activate "name_of_env"
```
- install tensorflow, tensorflow-gpu, keras, librosa and matplotlib (same like requirements.txt)
- install correct version of cudatoolkit: check version with
```bash
nvcc --version
```
and google for right version. When it's something like "Cuda compilation tools, release **9.1**, V9.1.85", you can install 9.1 like this:
(from https://anaconda.org/numba/cudatoolkit)
```bash
conda install -c numba cudatoolkit 
```
